# CheckHQ.com PHP SDK

I want to interact with CheckHQ.com to use in another project, so I will put together an SDK around their endpoints.

There wasn't much online that I could find, so I'll need to implement my own.

This is an unofficial, open source PHP SDK to interact with CheckHQ.com on the Laravel framework, or PHP project.
